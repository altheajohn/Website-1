## Introduction

Welcome to the Byjoe Jewelry Customer Order Form App
I wanted to create an app for cutomer intake on new orders.

In the App we start with the basic order form.

- Name
- E-mail
- Whom the order is for. This is important as order sizes need to be percise.
- Comment section for order details
  The order form also requires that each section of the form is filled out before the submit button works so a required atribute is embeded in the tag.

The the bottom of the page I want tp include a metal rates API. The metal rate API works along side the app beause it helps customers understand that jewelry prices can go up and down. In order for for the API to work you have to uncomment the code in the index.js file from lines 38 to 48 and you'll be about to click on the webpage button. I have commentted this out because there is a limited amount of pulls you are allowed a month (50 per month). While writing the code for the API I fetched the data about 40 times so I have 10 more left before it has to be paid for.

Below is a diagram of what the project wirefram will look like.
